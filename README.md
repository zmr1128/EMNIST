EMNIST character classification with CNNs - Tensorflow

The EMNIST dataset - an extension of the MNIST dataset - contains 10 digits, 52 alphabets (upper and lower case).
The training set contains 814,255 characters.

A 3 layer Convolutional Neural Network was used along with batch normalization, max pooling and dropout techniques. 
Model was trained using minibatch gradient descent and an Adam Optimizer in tensorflow.


the data set was obtained from https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset
